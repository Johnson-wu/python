<p>Scala code is often used in tandem with large Java programs and<!-- -->
frameworks.<a id="i373161214-1"></a><a id="i1128780868-2"></a> Since Scala is highly compatible with Java, most of the
time you can combine the languages without worrying very much.  For
example, standard frameworks such as Swing, Servlets, and JUnit are
known to work just fine with Scala.  Nonetheless, from time to time
you will run into some issue with combining Java and Scala.</p>

<p>This chapter describes two aspects of combining Java and Scala.
First, it discusses how Scala is translated to Java, which is
especially important if you call Scala code from Java.  Second, it
discusses the use of Java annotations in Scala, an important feature
if you want to use Scala with an existing Java framework.</p>

<h3><a name="29.1"></a>29.1 Using Scala from Java <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="combining-scala-and-java.html#29.1">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p>Most of the time you can think of Scala at the source code level.
However, you will have a richer understanding of how the system
works if you know something about its translation.  Further, if you
call Scala code from Java, you will need to know what Scala code looks
like from a Java point of view.</p>

<h4>General rules</h4>


<p>Scala is implemented as a translation to standard Java
bytecodes<a id="i-1806853862-1"></a>. As
much as possible, Scala features map directly onto the equivalent Java
features.  Scala classes, methods, strings, exceptions, for example,
are all compiled to the same in Java bytecode as their Java counterparts.</p>

<p>To make this happen required an occasional hard choice in the design
of Scala.  For example, it might have been nice to resolve overloaded
methods at run time, using run-time types, rather than at compile time.
Such a design would break with Java's, however, making it much
trickier to mesh Java and Scala.  In this case, Scala stays with
Java's overloading resolution, and thus Scala methods and method calls
can map directly to Java methods and method calls.</p>

<p>For other features Scala has its own design.  For example, traits have
no equivalent in Java.  Similarly, while both Scala and Java have
generic types, the details of the two systems clash.  For language
features like these, Scala code cannot be mapped directly to a Java
construct, so it must be encoded using some combination of the
structures Java does have.</p>

<p>For these features that are mapped indirectly, the encoding is not
fixed.  There is an ongoing effort to make the translations as simple
as possible, so by the time you read this, some details may be
different than at the time of writing.  You can find out what
translation your current Scala compiler uses by examining the
"<span class="texttt">.class</span>" files with tools like <span class="texttt">javap</span>.</p>

<p>Those are the general rules.  Consider now some special cases.</p>

<h4>Value types</h4>


<p>A value type like <span class="code">Int</span> can be translated in two different ways to
Java.<a id="i840866566-1"></a>  Whenever possible, the compiler translates a Scala <span class="code">Int</span> to a
Java <span class="code">int</span> to get better performance.<a id="i884498802-4"></a>  Sometimes this is not possible, though,
because the compiler is not sure whether it is translating an <span class="code">Int</span>
or some other data type.  For example, a particular List[Any] might
hold only <span class="code">Int</span>s, but the compiler has no way to be sure.</p>

<p>In cases like this, where the compiler is unsure whether an object
is a value type or not, the compiler uses objects and relies on wrapper
classes.  Wrapper classes such as, for example, <span class="code">java.lang.Integer</span> allow
a value type to be wrapped inside a Java object and thereby manipulated
by code that needs objects.<a href="combining-scala-and-java.html#footnote29-1">[1]</a></p>

<h4>Singleton objects</h4>


<p>Java has no exact equivalent to a singleton object, but it does have
static methods.<a id="i-1734369148-1"></a> 
The Scala translation of singleton objects uses a combination of static
and instance methods.<a id="i-855208314-1"></a>
For every Scala singleton object, the compiler will create a Java class
for the object with a dollar sign added to the end.  For a singleton
object named <span class="code">App</span>, the compiler produces a Java class named
<span class="code">App$</span>.  This class has all the methods and fields of the Scala
singleton object.  The Java class also has a single static field named
<span class="code">MODULE$</span> to hold the one instance of the class that is created at
run time.</p>

<p>As a full example, suppose you compile the following singleton object:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">object</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">App</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;main(args:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Array[String]</span>)&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println(<span class="quotedstring">"Hello,&nbsp;world!"</span>)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
  }
</pre><!-- -->
Scala will generate a Java <span class="code">App$</span> class with the following
fields and methods:</p>

<pre>
  $&nbsp;javap&nbsp;<span class="typename">App</span>$
  <span class="output">public&nbsp;final&nbsp;class&nbsp;App$&nbsp;extends&nbsp;java.lang.Object</span>
  <span class="output">implements&nbsp;scala.ScalaObject{</span>
  <span class="output">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;static&nbsp;final&nbsp;App$&nbsp;MODULE$;</span>
  <span class="output">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;static&nbsp;{};</span>
  <span class="output">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;App$();</span>
  <span class="output">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;void&nbsp;main(java.lang.String[]);</span>
  <span class="output">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;int&nbsp;$tag();</span>
  <span class="output">}</span>
</pre><!-- -->
That's the translation for the general case.
An important special case is if you have a "standalone" singleton object, one which does 
not come with a class of the same name.  For example, you might have a
singleton object named <span class="code">App</span>, and not have any class named
<span class="code">App</span>.  In that case, the compiler will create a Java class named
<span class="code">App</span> that has a static forwarder method for each method of
the Scala singleton object:


<pre>
  $&nbsp;javap&nbsp;<span class="typename">App</span>
  <span class="output">Compiled&nbsp;from&nbsp;"App.scala"</span>
  <span class="output">public&nbsp;final&nbsp;class&nbsp;App&nbsp;extends&nbsp;java.lang.Object{</span>
  <span class="output">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;static&nbsp;final&nbsp;int&nbsp;$tag();</span>
  <span class="output">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;static&nbsp;final&nbsp;void&nbsp;main(java.lang.String[]);</span>
  <span class="output">}</span>
</pre><!-- -->
To contrast, if you did have a class named <span class="code">App</span>, Scala would
create a corresponding Java <span class="code">App</span> class to hold the members
of the <span class="code">App</span> class you defined.  In that case it would not add any forwarding
methods for the same-named singleton object, and Java code would have
to access the singleton via the <span class="code">MODULE$</span>
field.


<h4>Traits as interfaces</h4>


<p>Compiling any trait creates a Java interface of the same
name.<a id="i286095114-1"></a><a id="i1983011802-1"></a>  This
interface is usable as a Java type, and it lets you call methods on
Scala objects through variables of that type.</p>

<p>Implementing a trait in Java is another story.  
In the general case it is not practical.
One special case is
important, however.  If you make a Scala trait that includes only
abstract methods, then that trait will be translated directly to a
Java interface, with no other code to worry about.  Essentially this
means that you can write a Java interface in Scala syntax if you like.</p>

<h3><a name="29.2"></a>29.2 Annotations <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="combining-scala-and-java.html#29.2">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p><a name="sec:annotations"></a></p>

<p>Scala's general annotations system is discussed in
<a href="annotations.html">Chapter 25</a>.  This section discusses Java-specific
aspects of annotations.<a id="i-311881081-1"></a></p>

<h4>Additional effects from standard annotations</h4>


<p>Several annotations cause the compiler to emit extra information when
targeting the Java platform.  When the compiler sees such an annotation, it first
processes it according to the general Scala rules, and then it
does something extra for Java.</p>

<p><b>Deprecation</b>
For any method or class marked <span class="code">@deprecated</span>,<a id="i-1632344653-2"></a> the
compiler will add Java's own deprecation annotation to the
emitted code.  Because of this, Java compilers can issue
deprecation warnings when Java code accesses
deprecated Scala methods.</p>

<p><b>Volatile fields</b>
Likewise, any field marked <span class="code">@volatile</span><a id="i-882906061-2"></a> in Scala is given the
Java <span class="code">volatile</span> modifier in the emitted code.  Thus, volatile
fields in Scala behave exactly according to Java's semantics, and
accesses to volatile fields are sequenced precisely according to the
rules specified for volatile fields in the Java memory model.</p>

<p><b>Serialization</b></p>

<p>Scala's three standard serialization annotations are all
translated to Java equivalents.  A <span class="code">@serializable</span><a id="i-534731536-2"></a><a id="i-897281643-2"></a> class has
Java's <span class="code">Serializable</span> interface added to it.  A
<span class="code">@SerialVersionUID(1234L)</span> annotation is converted to the
following Java field definition:
<pre>
  <span class="comment">//&nbsp;Java&nbsp;serial&nbsp;version&nbsp;marker</span>
  <span class="vem">private</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">final</span>&nbsp;static&nbsp;long&nbsp;<span class="typename">SerialVersionUID</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="literal">1234L</span>
</pre><!-- -->
Any variable marked <span class="code">@transient</span> is given the Java
<span class="code">transient</span> modifier.</p>

<h4>Exceptions thrown</h4>


<p>Scala does not check that thrown exceptions are caught.<a id="i-767472144-1"></a>  That is,
Scala has no equivalent to Java's <span class="code">throws</span> declarations on
methods.<a id="i1515336401-1"></a><a id="i993633856-1"></a><a id="i1490895901-2"></a>
All Scala methods are translated to Java methods that declare no thrown
exceptions.<a href="combining-scala-and-java.html#footnote29-2">[2]</a></p>

<p>The reason this feature is omitted from Scala is that the Java
experience with it has not been purely positive.  Because annotating methods with <span class="code">throws</span>
clauses is a heavy burden, too many developers write code
that swallows and drops exceptions, just to get the code to compile without adding all those <span class="code">throws</span> clauses.
They may intend to improve the exception handling later, but experience
shows that all too often time-pressed programmers will never come back
and add proper exception handling.  The twisted result is that this
well-intentioned feature often ends up making code <em>less</em>
reliable.  A large amount of production Java code swallows and hides
runtime exceptions, and the reason it does so is to satisfy the
compiler.</p>

<p>Sometimes when interfacing to Java, however, you may need to write Scala code that
has
Java-friendly annotations describing which exceptions your methods may throw.
For example, each method in an RMI remote interface is required to
mention <span class="code">java.io.RemoteException</span> in its <span class="code">throws</span> clause.
Thus, if you wish to write an RMI remote interface as a Scala trait with abstract methods, you would need to 
list <span class="code">RemoteException</span> in the <span class="code">throws</span> clauses for those methods.
To accomplish this, all you have to do
is mark your methods with <span class="code">@throws</span><a id="i-1229583646-1"></a><a id="i1626806115-1"></a> annotations.
For example, the Scala class shown in <a href="combining-scala-and-java.html#lst:throws-clause">Listing 29.1</a> has a method marked as throwing
<span class="code">IOException</span>.</p>

<p><a name="lst:throws-clause"></a></p>

<pre>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">import</span>&nbsp;java.io._
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Reader</span>(fname:&nbsp;<span class="typename">String</span>)&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">private</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;in&nbsp;=
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">BufferedReader</span>(<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">FileReader</span>(fname))
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@throws(classOf[<span class="typename">IOException</span>])
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;read()&nbsp;=&nbsp;in.read()
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- -->


<h5>Listing 29.1 - A Scala method that declares a Java <span class="code">throws</span> clause.</h5>


<p>Here is how it looks from Java:<a id="i1433885554-2"></a><a id="i385195690-2"></a></p>

<pre>
  $&nbsp;javap&nbsp;Reader
  <span class="output">Compiled&nbsp;from&nbsp;"Reader.scala"</span>
  <span class="output">public&nbsp;class&nbsp;Reader&nbsp;extends&nbsp;java.lang.Object&nbsp;implements</span>
  <span class="output">scala.ScalaObject{</span>
  <span class="output">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;Reader(java.lang.String);</span>
  <span class="output">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;int&nbsp;read()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throws&nbsp;java.io.IOException;</span>
  <span class="output">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;int&nbsp;$tag();</span>
  <span class="output">}</span>
  $
</pre><!-- -->
Note that the <span class="code">read</span> method indicates with a Java <span class="code">throws</span> clause that it
may throw
an <span class="code">IOException</span>.<!-- -->


<h4>Java annotations</h4>


<p>Existing annotations from Java frameworks can be used directly in Scala code.
Any Java framework will see the annotations you write just as if you
were writing in Java.</p>

<p>A wide variety of Java packages use annotations.  As an example,
consider JUnit 4.<a id="i70981870-3"></a> JUnit is a framework for writing automated tests
and for running those tests.  The latest version, JUnit 4, uses
annotations to indicate which parts of your code are tests.  The idea
is that you write a lot of tests for your code, and then you run those
tests whenever you change the source code.  That way, if your changes
add a new bug, one of the tests will fail and you will find out
immediately.</p>

<p>Writing a test is easy.  You simply write a method in a top-level
class that exercises your code, and you use an annotation to mark the
method as a test.  It looks like this:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">import</span>&nbsp;org.junit.Test
  <span class="vem">import</span>&nbsp;org.junit.Assert.assertEquals
  <br />  <span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">SetTest</span>&nbsp;{
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;@<span class="typename">Test</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;testMultiAdd&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;set&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="typename">Set</span>()&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="literal">1</span>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="literal">2</span>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="literal">3</span>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="literal">1</span>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="literal">2</span>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="literal">3</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(<span class="literal">3</span>,&nbsp;set.size)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
  }
</pre><!-- -->
The <span class="code">testMultiAdd</span> method is a test.  This test adds multiple items
to a set and makes sure that each is added only once.  The
<span class="code">assertEquals</span> method, which comes as part of the JUnit API, checks
that its two arguments are equal.  If they are different, then the
test fails.  In this case, the test verifies that repeatedly adding
the same numbers does not increase the size of a set.</p>

<p>The test is marked using the annotation <span class="code">org.junit.Test</span>. Note that
this annotation has been imported, so it can be referred to as simply
<span class="code">@Test</span> instead of the more cumbersome <span class="code">@org.junit.Test</span>.<a id="i-1737029383-1"></a><a id="i-380372540-1"></a></p>

<p>That's all there is to it.  The test can be run using any JUnit test
runner.  Here it is being run with the command-line test
runner:<!-- --></p>

<pre>
  $&nbsp;scala&nbsp;-cp&nbsp;junit-4.3.<span class="literal">1.</span>jar:.&nbsp;<span class="typename">org.junit.runner.JUnitCore</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">SetTest</span>
  <span class="output">JUnit&nbsp;version&nbsp;4.3.1</span>
  <span class="output">.</span>
  <span class="output">Time:&nbsp;0.023</span>
  <span class="output"></span>
  <span class="output">OK&nbsp;(1&nbsp;test)</span>
</pre><!-- -->


<h4>Writing your own annotations</h4>


<p>To make an annotation that is visible to Java reflection,<a id="i-244877014-1"></a> you must use<a id="i-1366299605-1"></a>
Java notation and compile it with <span class="code">javac</span><a id="i-1137870217-1"></a>.
For this use case, writing the annotation in Scala does not seem
helpful, so the standard compiler does not support it.
The reasoning is that the Scala support would inevitably fall short of
the full possibilities of Java annotations, and further, Scala will probably
one day have its own reflection, in which case you would want to
access Scala annotations with Scala reflection.</p>

<p>Here is an example annotation:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">import</span>&nbsp;java.lang.annotation.*;
  @<span class="typename">Retention</span>(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  @<span class="typename">Target</span>(ElementType.METHOD)
  public&nbsp;@interface&nbsp;<span class="typename">Ignore</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- -->
After compiling the above with <span class="code">javac</span>, you can use the annotation
as follows:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">object</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Tests</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;@<span class="typename">Ignore</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;testData&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="typename">List</span>(<span class="literal">0</span>,&nbsp;<span class="literal">1</span>,&nbsp;-<span class="literal">1</span>,&nbsp;<span class="literal">5</span>,&nbsp;-<span class="literal">5</span>)
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;test1&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assert(testData&nbsp;==&nbsp;(testData.head&nbsp;::&nbsp;testData.tail))
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;test2&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assert(testData.contains(testData.head))
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
  }
</pre><!-- -->
In this example, <span class="code">test1</span> and <span class="code">test2</span> are supposed to be
test methods, but <span class="code">testData</span> should be ignored even though
its name starts with "test".</p>

<p>To see when these annotations are present, you can use the Java
reflection APIs.  Here is sample code to show how it works:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">for</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;method&nbsp;&lt;-&nbsp;Tests.getClass.getMethods
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">if</span>&nbsp;method.getName.startsWith(<span class="quotedstring">"test"</span>)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">if</span>&nbsp;method.getAnnotation(classOf[<span class="typename">Ignore</span>])&nbsp;==&nbsp;<span class="vem">null</span>
  }&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;println(<span class="quotedstring">"found&nbsp;a&nbsp;test&nbsp;method:&nbsp;"</span>&nbsp;+&nbsp;method)
  }
</pre><!-- -->
Here, the reflective methods <span class="code">getClass</span> and <span class="code">getMethods</span> are
used to
inspect all the fields of the input object's class.  These are
normal reflection methods.  The annotation-specific part is the use of
method <span class="code">getAnnotation</span>.  As of Java 1.5, many reflection objects have
a <span class="code">getAnnotation</span> method for searching for annotations of a specific
type.  In this case, the code looks for an annotation of our new
<span class="code">Ignore</span> type.  Since this is a Java API, success is indicated by
whether the result is <span class="code">null</span> or is an actual annotation object.</p>

<p>Here is the code in action:</p>

<pre>
  $&nbsp;javac&nbsp;Ignore.java
  $&nbsp;scalac&nbsp;Tests.scala
  $&nbsp;scalac&nbsp;FindTests.scala
  $&nbsp;scala&nbsp;<span class="typename">FindTests</span>
  <span class="output">found&nbsp;a&nbsp;test&nbsp;method:&nbsp;public&nbsp;void&nbsp;Tests$.test2()</span>
  <span class="output">found&nbsp;a&nbsp;test&nbsp;method:&nbsp;public&nbsp;void&nbsp;Tests$.test1()</span>
</pre><!-- -->
As an aside, notice that the methods are in class <span class="code">Tests$</span> instead
of class <span class="code">Tests</span> when viewed with Java reflection.  As described at
the beginning of the chapter, the implementation of a Scala singleton
object is placed in a Java class with a dollar sign added to the end
of its name.  In this case, the implementation of <span class="code">Tests</span> is in the
Java class <span class="code">Tests$</span>.


<p>Be aware that when you use Java annotations you have to work within
their limitations.  For example, you can only use constants,
not expressions, in the arguments to annotations.  You can support
<span class="code">@serial(1234)</span> but not <span class="code">@serial(x * 2)</span>, because <span class="code">x</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">*</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">2</span> is
not a constant.</p>

<h3><a name="29.3"></a>29.3 Existential types <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="combining-scala-and-java.html#29.3">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p><a name="sec:existentials"></a></p>

<p>All Java types have a Scala equivalent.<a id="i-531244609-2"></a><a id="i1673589657-2"></a>  This is necessary so that
Scala code can access any legal Java class.  Most of the time the
translation is straightforward.  <span class="code">Pattern</span> in Java is <span class="code">Pattern</span> in
Scala, and <span class="code">Iterator&lt;Component&gt;</span> in Java is <span class="code">Iterator[Component]</span> in
Scala.  For some cases, though, the Scala types you have seen so far
are not enough.  What can be done with Java wildcard types such as
<span class="code">Iterator&lt;?&gt;</span> or <span class="code">Iterator&lt;?</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Component&gt;</span>?  What can be
done about raw types like <span class="code">Iterator</span>, where the type parameter is omitted?
For wildcard types and raw types, Scala uses an extra kind of type<a id="i414933374-2"></a><a id="i1163979645-2"></a><a id="i-119763145-1"></a><a id="i-315542260-1"></a>
called an <a href="glossary.html#g-1470033894"><em>existential type</em></a>.</p>

<p>Existential types are a fully supported part of the language, but in
practice they are mainly used when accessing Java types from Scala.
This section gives a brief overview of how existential types work, but mostly
this is only useful so that you can understand compiler error messages
when your Scala code accesses Java code.</p>

<p>The general form of an existential type is as follows:<a id="i1318155814-1"></a>
<pre>
  <i>type</i>&nbsp;<span class="vem">forSome</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;<i>declarations</i>&nbsp;}

The <em>type</em> part is an arbitrary Scala type, and the
<em>declarations</em> part is a list of abstract <span class="code">val</span>s and <span class="code">type</span>s.
The interpretation is that the declared variables and types exist
but are unknown, just like abstract members of a class.  The
<em>type</em> is then allowed to refer to the declared variables and
types even though it is unknown what they refer to.</p>

<p>Take a look at some concrete examples.  A Java
<span class="code">Iterator&lt;?&gt;</span> would be written in Scala as:
<pre>
  <span class="typename">Iterator[T]</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">forSome</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;<span class="vem">type</span>&nbsp;T&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- -->
Read this from left to right.  This is an <span class="code">Iterator</span> of <span class="code">T</span>'s for
some type <span class="code">T</span>.  The type <span class="code">T</span> is unknown, and could be anything, but
it is known to be fixed for this particular <span class="code">Iterator</span>.  Similarly,
a Java <span class="code">Iterator&lt;?</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Component&gt;</span> would be viewed in Scala
as:
<pre>
  <span class="typename">Iterator[T]</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">forSome</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;<span class="vem">type</span>&nbsp;T&nbsp;&lt;:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Component</span>&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- -->
This is an <span class="code">Iterator</span> of <span class="code">T</span>, for some type <span class="code">T</span> that is a subtype
of <span class="code">Component</span>.  In this case <span class="code">T</span> is still unknown, but now it is
sure to be a subtype of <span class="code">Component</span>.</p>

<p>By the way, there is a shorter way to write these examples.  If you
write <span class="code">Iterator[_]</span>, it means the same thing as
<span class="code">Iterator[T]</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">forSome</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">{</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">type</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">T</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">}</span>.  This is <em>placeholder syntax</em>
for existential types, and is similar in spirit to the placeholder
syntax for function literals that was described in
<a href="functions-and-closures.html#sec:placeholder-syntax">Section 8.5</a>.<a id="i394425348-1"></a>
If you use an underscore (<span class="code">_</span>) in place of
an expression, then Scala treats this as a placeholder and makes a
function literal for you.  For types it works similarly.  If you use an
underscore in place of a type, Scala makes an existential type for you.
Each underscore becomes one type parameter in a <span class="code">forSome</span> clause, so if you
use two underscores in the same type, you will get the effect of a
<span class="code">forSome</span> clause with two types in it.</p>

<p>You can also insert upper and lower bounds when using this placeholder
syntax.  Simply add them to the underscore instead of in the <span class="code">forSome</span>
clause.  The type <span class="code">Iterator[_</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">&lt;:</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Component]</span> is the same as this one,
which you just saw:
<pre>
  <span class="typename">Iterator[T]</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">forSome</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;<span class="vem">type</span>&nbsp;T&nbsp;&lt;:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Component</span>&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- --></p>

<p>Enough about the existential types themselves.  How do you actually
use them?
Well, in simple cases, you use an existential type just as if the <span class="code">forSome</span>
were not there.  Scala will check that the program is sound even
though the types and values in the <span class="code">forSome</span> clause are unknown.
For example, suppose you had the following Java class:
<pre>
  //&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;Java&nbsp;class&nbsp;with&nbsp;wildcards
  public&nbsp;class&nbsp;Wild&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Collection&lt;?&gt;&nbsp;contents()&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection&lt;String&gt;&nbsp;stuff&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;Vector&lt;String&gt;();
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stuff.add("a");
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stuff.add("b");
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stuff.add("see");
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return&nbsp;stuff;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
  }
</pre><!-- -->
If you access this in Scala code you will see that it has an
existential type:</p>

<pre>
  scala&gt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;contents&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Wild</span>).contents
  <span class="output">contents:&nbsp;java.util.Collection[?0]&nbsp;forSome&nbsp;{&nbsp;type&nbsp;?0&nbsp;}&nbsp;=</span>
  <span class="output">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[a,&nbsp;b,&nbsp;see]</span>
</pre><!-- -->
If you want to find out how many elements are in this collection, you
can simply ignore the existential part and call the <span class="code">size</span> method as
normal:
<pre>
  scala&gt;&nbsp;contents.size()
  <span class="output">res0:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</span>
</pre><!-- -->
In more complicated cases, existential types can be more awkward,
because there is no way to name the existential type.  For example,
suppose you wanted to create a mutable Scala set and initialize
it with the elements of <span class="code">contents</span>:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">import</span>&nbsp;scala.collection.mutable.Set
  <span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;iter&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Wild</span>).contents.iterator
  <span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;set&nbsp;=&nbsp;Set.empty[???]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">//&nbsp;what&nbsp;type&nbsp;goes&nbsp;here?</span>
  <span class="vem">while</span>&nbsp;(iter.hasMore)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;set&nbsp;+=&nbsp;iter.next()
</pre><!-- -->
A problem strikes on the third line.  There is no way to name the type of
elements in the Java collection, so you cannot write down a
satisfactory type for <span class="code">set</span>.  To work around this kind of problem,
here are two tricks you should consider:


<ol>
<li>When passing an existential type into a method, move type parameters
      from the <span class="code">forSome</span> clause to type parameters of the method.  Inside
      the body of the method, you can use the type parameters to refer
      to the types that were in the <span class="code">forSome</span> clause.


    </li>
<li>Instead of returning an existential type from a method,
      return an object that has abstract members for each of the types
      in the <span class="code">forSome</span> clause.  (See
      <a href="abstract-members.html">Chapter 20</a> for information
      on abstract members.)
</li></ol>
Using these two tricks together, the previous code can be
written as follows:<!-- -->
<pre>
  <span class="vem">import</span>&nbsp;scala.collection.mutable.Set
  <span class="vem">import</span>&nbsp;java.util.Collection
  <br />  <span class="vem">abstract</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">SetAndType</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">type</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Elem</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;set:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Set[Elem]</span>
  }
  <br />  <span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;javaSet2ScalaSet[T](jset:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Collection[T]</span>):&nbsp;<span class="typename">SetAndType</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;sset&nbsp;=&nbsp;Set.empty[T]&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">//&nbsp;now&nbsp;T&nbsp;can&nbsp;be&nbsp;named!</span>
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;iter&nbsp;=&nbsp;jset.iterator
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">while</span>&nbsp;(iter.hasNext)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sset&nbsp;+=&nbsp;iter.next()
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">return</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">SetAndType</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">type</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Elem</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;T
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;set&nbsp;=&nbsp;sset
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
  }
</pre><!-- -->
You can see why Scala code normally does not use existential types.
To do anything sophisticated with them, you tend to convert them to
use abstract members.  So you may as well use abstract
members to begin with.


<h3><a name="29.4"></a>29.4 Conclusion <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="combining-scala-and-java.html#29.4">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p>Most of the time, you can ignore how Scala is implemented and simply
write and run your code.  Sometimes it is nice to "look under the
hood," however, so this chapter has gone into three aspects of
Scala's implementation on the Java platform: what the translation
looks like, how Scala and Java annotations work together, and how
Scala's existential types let you access Java wildcard types.  These
topics are important whenever you use Scala and Java
together.</p>

<p><a name="footnote29-1">[1]</a> The implementation of value types was discussed in detail in
<a href="scalas-hierarchy.html#sec:impl-primitives">Section 11.2</a>.</p>

<p><a name="footnote29-2">[2]</a> The reason it all works is that the Java bytecode
verifier does not check the declarations, anyway!  The Java compiler checks,
but not the verifier.</p>

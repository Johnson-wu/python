<p>Traits are a fundamental unit of code reuse in Scala.  A trait
encapsulates method and field definitions, which can then be reused by
mixing them into classes.  Unlike class inheritance, in which each class must
inherit from just one superclass, a class can mix in any number of
traits. This chapter shows you how traits work and shows two of the most
common ways they are useful: widening thin interfaces to rich ones,
and defining stackable modifications.  It also shows how to use the
 <span class="code">Ordered</span> trait and compares traits to the multiple
inheritance of other languages.</p>

<h3><a name="12.1"></a>12.1 How traits work <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="traits.html#12.1">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p>A trait definition looks just like a class definition except that it
uses the keyword <span class="code">trait</span>. An example is shown in <a href="traits.html#lst:defining-a-trait">Listing 12.1</a>:</p>

<p><a name="lst:defining-a-trait"></a></p>

<pre>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">trait</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Philosophical</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;philosophize()&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println(<span class="quotedstring">"I&nbsp;consume&nbsp;memory,&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;I&nbsp;am!"</span>)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- -->


<h5>Listing 12.1 - The definition of trait <span class="code">Philosophical</span>.</h5>


<p>This trait is named <span class="code">Philosophical</span>.  It does not declare a superclass,
so like a class, it has the
default superclass of <span class="code">AnyRef</span>.  It defines one method,
named <span class="code">philosophize</span>, which is concrete.  It's a simple trait,
just enough to show how traits work.</p>

<p>Once a trait is defined, it can be <em>mixed in</em> to a class using either the <span class="code">extends</span> or <span class="code">with</span>
keywords.<a id="i-1415422629-1"></a> Scala programmers "mix in" traits rather than
  inherit from them, because mixing in a trait has important
  differences from the multiple inheritance found in many other
  languages.<a id="i-917586794-1"></a> This issue is discussed in
  <a href="traits.html#sec:traits-vs-multi">Section 12.6</a>.
For example, <a href="traits.html#lst:extending-a-trait">Listing 12.2</a> shows a class that mixes in the <span class="code">Philosophical</span> trait using <span class="code">extends</span>:</p>

<p><a name="lst:extending-a-trait"></a></p>

<pre>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Frog</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Philosophical</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">override</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;toString&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="quotedstring">"green"</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- -->


<h5>Listing 12.2 - Mixing in a trait using <span class="code">extends</span>.</h5>


<p>You can use the <span class="code">extends</span> keyword to mix in a trait; in that case you implicitly inherit the trait's superclass.  
For instance, in <a href="traits.html#lst:extending-a-trait">Listing 12.2</a>, class <span class="code">Frog</span> subclasses <span class="code">AnyRef</span> (the superclass of <span class="code">Philosophical</span>) 
and mixes in <span class="code">Philosophical</span>.
Methods inherited from a trait can be used just like methods inherited
from a superclass. Here's an example:
<pre>
  scala&gt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;frog&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Frog</span>
  <span class="output">frog:&nbsp;Frog&nbsp;=&nbsp;green</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;frog.philosophize()
  <span class="output">I&nbsp;consume&nbsp;memory,&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;I&nbsp;am!</span>
</pre><!-- -->
A trait also defines a type.  Here's an example in which  <span class="code">Philosophical</span>
is used as a type:
<pre>
  scala&gt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;phil:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Philosophical</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;frog&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <span class="output">phil:&nbsp;Philosophical&nbsp;=&nbsp;green</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;phil.philosophize()
  <span class="output">I&nbsp;consume&nbsp;memory,&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;I&nbsp;am!</span>
</pre><!-- -->
The type of <span class="code">phil</span> is <span class="code">Philosophical</span>, a trait.  Thus, variable <span class="code">phil</span> could have been
initialized with any object whose class mixes in
<span class="code">Philosophical</span>.</p>

<p>If you wish to mix a trait into a class that explicitly extends a superclass, you use <span class="code">extends</span> to indicate the superclass and
<span class="code">with</span> to mix in the trait. <a href="traits.html#lst:mixing-in-using-with">Listing 12.3</a> shows an example.
If you want to mix in multiple traits, you add more <span class="code">with</span> clauses. For example, given a trait <span class="code">HasLegs</span>, you
could mix both <span class="code">Philosophical</span> and <span class="code">HasLegs</span> into <span class="code">Frog</span> as shown in <a href="traits.html#lst:multiple-withs">Listing 12.4</a>.</p>

<p><a name="lst:mixing-in-using-with"></a></p>

<pre>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Animal</span>
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Frog</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Animal</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Philosophical</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">override</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;toString&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="quotedstring">"green"</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- -->


<h5>Listing 12.3 - Mixing in a trait using <span class="code">with</span>.<a id="i1578124431-1"></a></h5>


<p><a name="lst:multiple-withs"></a></p>

<pre>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Animal</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">trait</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">HasLegs</span>
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Frog</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Animal</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Philosophical</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">HasLegs</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">override</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;toString&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="quotedstring">"green"</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- -->


<h5>Listing 12.4 - Mixing in multiple traits.</h5>


<p>In the examples you've seen so far, class <span class="code">Frog</span> has inherited an implementation of <span class="code">philosophize</span> from
trait <span class="code">Philosophical</span>. Alternatively, <span class="code">Frog</span> could
override <span class="code">philosophize</span>. The syntax looks the same as overriding a method declared in a superclass. Here's an example:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Animal</span>
  <br />  <span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Frog</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Animal</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Philosophical</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">override</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;toString&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="quotedstring">"green"</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">override</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;philosophize()&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println(<span class="quotedstring">"It&nbsp;ain't&nbsp;easy&nbsp;being&nbsp;"</span>+&nbsp;toString&nbsp;+<span class="quotedstring">"!"</span>)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
  }
</pre><!-- -->
Because this new definition of <span class="code">Frog</span> still mixes in trait <span class="code">Philosophical</span>, you can still use
it from a variable of that type. But because <span class="code">Frog</span> overrides <span class="code">Philosophical</span>'s implementation
of <span class="code">philosophize</span>, you'll get a new behavior when you call it:
<pre>
  scala&gt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;phrog:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Philosophical</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Frog</span>
  <span class="output">phrog:&nbsp;Philosophical&nbsp;=&nbsp;green</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;phrog.philosophize()
  <span class="output">It&nbsp;ain't&nbsp;easy&nbsp;being&nbsp;green!</span>
</pre><!-- -->
At this point you might philosophize that traits are like Java interfaces with concrete methods, but
they can actually do much more. Traits can, for example, declare fields and maintain state. In fact,
you can do anything in a trait definition that you can do in a class definition, and the syntax looks
exactly the same, with only two exceptions. First, a trait cannot have any "class" parameters,
<i>i.e.</i>, parameters passed to the primary constructor of a class.
In other words, although you could define a class like this:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Point</span>(x:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>,&nbsp;y:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>)
</pre><!-- -->
The following attempt to define a trait would not compile:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">trait</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">NoPoint</span>(x:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>,&nbsp;y:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>)&nbsp;<span class="comment">//&nbsp;Does&nbsp;not&nbsp;compile</span>
</pre><!-- -->
You'll find out in 
<a href="abstract-members.html#sec:val-init">Section 20.5</a> how to work around this restriction.</p>

<p>The other difference between classes and traits is that whereas in classes, <span class="code">super</span> calls are statically bound, in traits,<a id="i-718179772-1"></a>
they are dynamically bound.<a id="i-1297249718-2"></a>
If you write
"<span class="code">super.toString</span>" in a class, you know exactly which method implementation
will be invoked.  When you write the same thing in a trait, however, the 
method implementation to invoke for the <span class="code">super</span> call is undefined when you define the trait. Rather, the
implementation to invoke will be determined
anew each time the trait is mixed into a concrete class.  This curious behavior of <span class="code">super</span> is key to allowing
traits to work as  <em>stackable modifications</em>, which will be described in
<a href="traits.html#sec:stackable-modifications">Section 12.5</a>.  The rules for resolving <span class="code">super</span> calls  will be
given in <a href="traits.html#sec:traits-vs-multi">Section 12.6</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="12.2"></a>12.2 Thin versus rich interfaces <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="traits.html#12.2">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p>One major use of traits is to automatically add methods to a class in
terms of methods the class already has.  That is, traits can
enrich a <em>thin</em> interface, making it into a <em>rich</em> interface.<!-- --></p>

<p>Thin versus rich interfaces represents a commonly faced trade-off in
object-oriented design.  The trade-off is between the implementers and
the clients of an interface.  A rich interface has many methods, which
make it convenient for the caller.  Clients can pick a method that
exactly matches the functionality they need.  A thin interface, on the
other hand, has fewer methods, and thus is easier on the implementers.
Clients calling into a thin interface, however, have to write more
code.  Given the smaller selection of methods to call, they may have
to choose a less than perfect match for their needs and write extra code to use it.</p>

<p>Java's interfaces are more often thin than rich.  For example,
interface
<span class="code">CharSequence</span>, which was introduced in Java 1.4, is a thin interface common to all
string-like classes that hold a sequence of characters.  Here's its 
definition when seen as a Scala trait:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">trait</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">CharSequence</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;charAt(index:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>):&nbsp;<span class="typename">Char</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;length:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;subSequence(start:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>,&nbsp;end:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>):&nbsp;<span class="typename">CharSequence</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;toString():&nbsp;<span class="typename">String</span>
  }
</pre><!-- -->
Although most of the dozens of methods in class <span class="code">String</span> would apply to any
<span class="code">CharSequence</span>, Java's <span class="code">CharSequence</span> interface declares only four
methods.  Had <span class="code">CharSequence</span> instead included the full <span class="code">String</span>
interface, it would have placed a large burden on implementers of
<span class="code">CharSequence</span>.  Every programmer that implemented <span class="code">CharSequence</span> in Java would have had to define dozens more methods.
Because Scala traits can contain concrete methods, they make rich interfaces far more convenient.</p>

<p>Adding a concrete method to a trait tilts the thin-rich trade-off
heavily towards rich interfaces.  Unlike in Java,  adding
a concrete method to a Scala trait is a one-time effort.  You only
need to implement the method once, in the trait itself, instead of
needing to reimplement it for every class that mixes in the trait.
Thus, rich interfaces are less work to provide in Scala than in a
language without traits.</p>

<p>To enrich an interface using traits, simply define a trait with
a small number of abstract methods&mdash;the thin part of the trait's
interface&mdash;and a potentially large number of concrete methods, all implemented in terms
of the abstract methods. Then you can mix the enrichment trait into a class, implement the
thin portion of the interface, and end up with
a class that has all of the rich interface available.</p>

<h3><a name="12.3"></a>12.3 Example: Rectangular objects <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="traits.html#12.3">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p>Graphics libraries often have
many different classes that represent something rectangular. Some examples are windows,
bitmap images, and regions selected with a mouse.  To make these rectangular objects
convenient to use, it is nice if the library provides geometric
queries such as <span class="code">width</span>, <span class="code">height</span>, <span class="code">left</span>, <span class="code">right</span>, <span class="code">topLeft</span>,
and so on.  However, many such methods exist that would be nice to
have, so it can be a large burden on library writers to provide all of them for all rectangular objects in a Java library.  If such a library were
written in Scala, by contrast, the library writer could use traits to
easily supply all of these convenience methods on all the classes they'd
like.</p>

<p>To see how, first imagine what the code would look like without
traits.  There would be some basic geometric classes like <span class="code">Point</span> and
<span class="code">Rectangle</span>:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Point</span>(<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;x:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>,&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;y:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>)
  <br />  <span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rectangle</span>(<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;topLeft:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Point</span>,&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;bottomRight:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Point</span>)&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;left&nbsp;=&nbsp;topLeft.x
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;right&nbsp;=&nbsp;bottomRight.x
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;width&nbsp;=&nbsp;right&nbsp;-&nbsp;left
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">//&nbsp;and&nbsp;many&nbsp;more&nbsp;geometric&nbsp;methods...</span>
  }
</pre><!-- -->
This <span class="code">Rectangle</span> class takes two points in its primary constructor:
the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners.  It then implements many convenience methods such
as <span class="code">left</span>, <span class="code">right</span>, and <span class="code">width</span> by performing simple calculations
on these two points.</p>

<p>Another class a graphics library might have is a 2-D graphical widget:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">abstract</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Component</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;topLeft:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Point</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;bottomRight:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Point</span>
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;left&nbsp;=&nbsp;topLeft.x
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;right&nbsp;=&nbsp;bottomRight.x
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;width&nbsp;=&nbsp;right&nbsp;-&nbsp;left
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">//&nbsp;and&nbsp;many&nbsp;more&nbsp;geometric&nbsp;methods...</span>
  }
</pre><!-- -->
Notice that the definitions of <span class="code">left</span>, <span class="code">right</span>, and <span class="code">width</span> are
exactly the same in the two classes.  They will also be the same,
aside from minor variations, in any other classes for rectangular
objects.</p>

<p>This repetition can be eliminated with an enrichment trait. The trait
will have two abstract methods: one that
returns the top-left coordinate of the object, and another that returns
the bottom-right coordinate.
It can then supply concrete implementations of all the other geometric
queries.  <a href="traits.html#lst:enrichment-trait">Listing 12.5</a> shows what it will look like:</p>

<p><a name="lst:enrichment-trait"></a></p>

<pre>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">trait</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rectangular</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;topLeft:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Point</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;bottomRight:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Point</span>
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;left&nbsp;=&nbsp;topLeft.x
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;right&nbsp;=&nbsp;bottomRight.x
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;width&nbsp;=&nbsp;right&nbsp;-&nbsp;left
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">//&nbsp;and&nbsp;many&nbsp;more&nbsp;geometric&nbsp;methods...</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- -->


<h5>Listing 12.5 - Defining an enrichment trait.</h5>


<p>Class <span class="code">Component</span> can mix in this trait to get all the geometric
methods provided by <span class="code">Rectangular</span>:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">abstract</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Component</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rectangular</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">//&nbsp;other&nbsp;methods...</span>
  }
</pre><!-- -->
Similarly, <span class="code">Rectangle</span> itself can mix in the trait:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rectangle</span>(<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;topLeft:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Point</span>,&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;bottomRight:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Point</span>)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rectangular</span>&nbsp;{
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">//&nbsp;other&nbsp;methods...</span>
  }
</pre><!-- -->
Given these definitions, you can create a <span class="code">Rectangle</span> and
call geometric methods such as <span class="code">width</span> and <span class="code">left</span> on it:
<pre>
  scala&gt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;rect&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rectangle</span>(<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Point</span>(<span class="literal">1</span>,&nbsp;<span class="literal">1</span>),
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Point</span>(<span class="literal">10</span>,&nbsp;<span class="literal">10</span>))
  <span class="output">rect:&nbsp;Rectangle&nbsp;=&nbsp;Rectangle@3536fd</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;rect.left
  <span class="output">res2:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;rect.right
  <span class="output">res3:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;10</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;rect.width
  <span class="output">res4:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;9</span>
</pre><!-- --></p>

<h3><a name="12.4"></a>12.4 The <span class="code">Ordered</span> trait <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="traits.html#12.4">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p><a name="sec:the-ordered-trait"></a></p>

<p>Comparison is another domain where a rich interface is convenient.<a id="i2068605051-1"></a><a id="i795809807-1"></a>
Whenever you compare two objects that are ordered, it is convenient if
you use a single method call to ask about the precise comparison you
want.  If you want "is less than," you would like to call <span class="code">&lt;</span>, and
if you want "is less than or equal," you would like to call <span class="code">&lt;=</span>.
With a thin comparison interface, you might just have the <span class="code">&lt;</span> method, and you would sometimes have to write things like
"<span class="code">(x</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">&lt;</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">y)</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">||</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">(x</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">==</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">y)</span>".  A rich interface would provide you with
all of the usual comparison operators, thus allowing you to directly
write things like "<span class="code">x</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">&lt;=</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">y</span>".</p>

<p>Before looking at <span class="code">Ordered</span>, imagine
what you might do without it.  Suppose
you took the <span class="code">Rational</span> class from
<a href="functional-objects.html">Chapter 6</a> and added comparison operations to
it.  You would end up with something like this:<a href="traits.html#footnote12-1">[1]</a>
<pre>
  <span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rational</span>(n:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>,&nbsp;d:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>)&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">//&nbsp;...</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;(that:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rational</span>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">this</span>.numer&nbsp;*&nbsp;that.denom&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;that.numer&nbsp;*&nbsp;<span class="vem">this</span>.denom
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;(that:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rational</span>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;that&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">this</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;(that:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rational</span>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<span class="vem">this</span>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;that)&nbsp;||&nbsp;(<span class="vem">this</span>&nbsp;==&nbsp;that)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;(that:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rational</span>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<span class="vem">this</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;that)&nbsp;||&nbsp;(<span class="vem">this</span>&nbsp;==&nbsp;that)

This class defines four comparison operators (<span class="code">&lt;</span>, <span class="code">&gt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;=</span>, and
<span class="code">&gt;=</span>), and it's
a classic demonstration of the costs of defining a
rich interface.  First, notice that three of the comparison operators
are defined in terms of the first one.  For example, <span class="code">&gt;</span> is defined
as the reverse of <span class="code">&lt;</span>, and <span class="code">&lt;=</span> is defined as literally "less than
or equal."  Additionally, notice that all three of these methods
would be the same for any other class that is comparable.  There is
nothing special about rational numbers regarding <span class="code">&lt;=</span>.  In a comparison context,
<span class="code">&lt;=</span> is <em>always</em> used to mean "less than or equals."  Overall, there
is quite a lot of boilerplate code in this class which would be the
same in any other class that implements comparison operations.</p>

<p>This problem is so common that Scala provides a trait to help with
it.  The trait is called <span class="code">Ordered</span>.  To use it, you replace all of
the individual comparison methods with a single <span class="code">compare</span> method.<a id="i1970675952-1"></a>
The <span class="code">Ordered</span> trait then defines <span class="code">&lt;</span>, <span class="code">&gt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;=</span>, and <span class="code">&gt;=</span> for you
in terms of this one method. Thus, trait <span class="code">Ordered</span> allows you to enrich a class
with comparison methods by implementing only one method, <span class="code">compare</span>.</p>

<p>Here is how it looks if you define comparison operations on <span class="code">Rational</span>
by using the <span class="code">Ordered</span> trait:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rational</span>(n:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>,&nbsp;d:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>)&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Ordered[Rational]</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">//&nbsp;...</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;compare(that:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rational</span>)&nbsp;=
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class="vem">this</span>.numer&nbsp;*&nbsp;that.denom)&nbsp;-&nbsp;(that.numer&nbsp;*&nbsp;<span class="vem">this</span>.denom)
  }
</pre><!-- -->
There are just two things to do.  First, this version of <span class="code">Rational</span>
mixes in the <span class="code">Ordered</span> trait.  Unlike the traits you have seen so
far, <span class="code">Ordered</span> requires you to specify a <a href="glossary.html#g772613699"><em>type parameter</em></a> when
you mix it in.  Type parameters are not discussed in detail until
<a href="type-parameterization.html">Chapter 19</a>, but for now all you need to
know is that when you mix in <span class="code">Ordered</span>, you must actually mix in
<span class="code">Ordered[</span><em>C</em><span class="code">]</span>, where <em>C</em> is the class
whose elements you compare.  In this case, <span class="code">Rational</span> mixes in
<span class="code">Ordered[Rational]</span>.</p>

<p>The second thing you need to do is define a <span class="code">compare</span> method for
comparing two objects.  This method should compare the receiver,
<span class="code">this</span>, with the object passed as an argument to the method.  It
should return an integer that is zero if the objects are the same,
negative if receiver is less than the argument, and positive if the
receiver is greater than the argument.
In this case, the comparison method of <span class="code">Rational</span> uses a formula
based on converting the fractions to a common denominator and
then subtracting the resulting numerators.
Given this mixin and the definition of <span class="code">compare</span>, class <span class="code">Rational</span>
now has all four comparison methods:
<pre>
  scala&gt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;half&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rational</span>(<span class="literal">1</span>,&nbsp;<span class="literal">2</span>)
  <span class="output">half:&nbsp;Rational&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/2</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;third&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Rational</span>(<span class="literal">1</span>,&nbsp;<span class="literal">3</span>)
  <span class="output">third:&nbsp;Rational&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/3</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;half&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;third
  <span class="output">res5:&nbsp;Boolean&nbsp;=&nbsp;false</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;half&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;third
  <span class="output">res6:&nbsp;Boolean&nbsp;=&nbsp;true</span>
</pre><!-- --></p>

<p>Any time you implement a class that is ordered by some comparison, you
should consider mixing in the <span class="code">Ordered</span> trait.  If you do, you will provide
the class's users with a rich
set of comparison methods.</p>

<p>Beware that the <span class="code">Ordered</span> trait does not define <span class="code">equals</span> for you,
because it is unable to do so. The problem is that implementing
<span class="code">equals</span> in terms of <span class="code">compare</span> requires checking the type of the
passed object, and because of type erasure, <span class="code">Ordered</span> itself cannot
do this test.  Thus, you need to define <span class="code">equals</span> yourself, even if
you inherit <span class="code">Ordered</span>.  You'll find out how to go about this in
<a href="object-equality.html">Chapter 28</a>.</p>

<p>The complete <span class="code">Ordered</span> trait, minus comments and compatibility cruft, is
as follows:
<pre>
  <span class="vem">trait</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Ordered[T]</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;compare(that:&nbsp;T):&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;&lt;(that:&nbsp;T):&nbsp;<span class="typename">Boolean</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<span class="vem">this</span>&nbsp;compare&nbsp;that)&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<span class="literal">0</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;&gt;(that:&nbsp;T):&nbsp;<span class="typename">Boolean</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<span class="vem">this</span>&nbsp;compare&nbsp;that)&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span class="literal">0</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;&lt;=(that:&nbsp;T):&nbsp;<span class="typename">Boolean</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<span class="vem">this</span>&nbsp;compare&nbsp;that)&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;<span class="literal">0</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;&gt;=(that:&nbsp;T):&nbsp;<span class="typename">Boolean</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<span class="vem">this</span>&nbsp;compare&nbsp;that)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<span class="literal">0</span>
  }
</pre><!-- -->
Do not worry much about the <span class="code">T</span>'s and <span class="code">[T]</span>'s.  <span class="code">T</span> here is a
<a href="glossary.html#g772613699">type parameter</a>, as described in detail in
<a href="type-parameterization.html">Chapter 19</a>.  For understanding the
<span class="code">Ordered</span> trait, just think of it as "the same type as the
receiver".  You can then see that this trait defines one abstract
method, <span class="code">compare</span>, which is expected to compare the receiver (<span class="code">this</span>)
against another object of the same type as the receiver (<span class="code">that</span>).
Given this one method, <span class="code">Ordered</span> can then provide concrete
definitions for <span class="code">&lt;</span>, <span class="code">&gt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;=</span>, and <span class="code">&gt;=</span>.</p>

<h3><a name="12.5"></a>12.5 Traits as stackable modifications <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="traits.html#12.5">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p><a name="sec:stackable-modifications"></a></p>

<p>You have now seen one major use of traits: turning a thin interface<a id="i-590612839-1"></a>
into a rich one.  Now we'll turn to a second major use: providing
stackable modifications to classes.  Traits let you <em>modify</em> the
methods of a class, and they do so in a way that allows you to <em>stack</em>
those modifications with each other.</p>

<p>As an example, consider stacking modifications to a queue of integers.
The queue will have two operations: <span class="code">put</span>, which places integers in the queue, and <span class="code">get</span>, which takes them back out.  Queues are
first-in, first-out, so <span class="code">get</span> should return the integers in the same
order they were put in the queue.</p>

<p>Given a class that implements such a queue, you could define traits to 
perform modifications such as these:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="code">Doubling</span>: double all integers that are put in the queue
</li>
<li><span class="code">Incrementing</span>: increment all integers that are put in the queue
</li>
<li><span class="code">Filtering</span>: filter out negative integers from a queue
</li></ul>


<p>These three traits represent <em>modifications</em>, because they modify the
behavior of an underlying queue class rather than defining a full
queue class themselves.  The three are also <em>stackable</em>.  You
can select any of the three you like, mix them into a class, and obtain
a new class that has all of the modifications you chose.</p>

<p>An abstract <span class="code">IntQueue</span> class is shown in <a href="traits.html#lst:class-intqueue">Listing 12.6</a>.
<span class="code">IntQueue</span> has a <span class="code">put</span> method that 
adds new integers to the queue and a <span class="code">get</span> method that removes and returns them.
A basic
implementation of <span class="code">IntQueue</span> that uses an <span class="code">ArrayBuffer</span> is shown in <a href="traits.html#lst:basic-intqueue">Listing 12.7</a>.</p>

<p><a name="lst:class-intqueue"></a></p>

<pre>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">abstract</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">IntQueue</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;get():&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;put(x:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- -->

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;put(x:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>)&nbsp;{&nbsp;buf&nbsp;+=&nbsp;x&nbsp;}
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- -->


<h5>Listing 12.7 - A <span class="code">BasicIntQueue</span> implemented with an <span class="code">ArrayBuffer</span>.</h5>


<p>Class <span class="code">BasicIntQueue</span> has a private field holding an array buffer.  The
<span class="code">get</span> method removes an entry from one end of the buffer, while the
<span class="code">put</span> method adds elements to the other end.  Here's how this
implementation looks when you use it:
<pre>
  scala&gt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;queue&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">BasicIntQueue</span>
  <span class="output">queue:&nbsp;BasicIntQueue&nbsp;=&nbsp;BasicIntQueue@24655f</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.put(<span class="literal">10</span>)
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.put(<span class="literal">20</span>)
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.get()
  <span class="output">res9:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;10</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.get()
  <span class="output">res10:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;20</span>
</pre><!-- --></p>

<p>So far so good.  Now take a look at using traits to modify this
behavior.  <a href="traits.html#lst:doubling-trait">Listing 12.8</a> shows a trait that doubles integers as they are
put in the queue.
The <span class="code">Doubling</span> trait has two funny things going on.  The first is that it
declares a superclass, <span class="code">IntQueue</span>.  This declaration means that the
trait can only be mixed into a class that also extends <span class="code">IntQueue</span>.  Thus, you
can mix <span class="code">Doubling</span> into <span class="code">BasicIntQueue</span>, but not into <span class="code">Rational</span>.</p>

<p><a name="lst:doubling-trait"></a></p>

<pre>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">trait</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Doubling</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">IntQueue</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">abstract</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">override</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;put(x:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>)&nbsp;{&nbsp;<span class="vem">super</span>.put(<span class="literal">2</span>&nbsp;*&nbsp;x)&nbsp;}
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- -->


<h5>Listing 12.8 - The <span class="code">Doubling</span> stackable modification trait.</h5>


<p>The second funny thing is that the trait has a <span class="code">super</span> call on a
method declared abstract.  Such calls are illegal for normal classes,
because they will certainly fail at run time.  For a trait, however,
such a call can actually succeed.  Since <span class="code">super</span> calls in a trait are
dynamically bound, the <span class="code">super</span> call in trait <span class="code">Doubling</span> will work so
long as the trait is mixed in <em>after</em> another trait or class
that gives a concrete definition to the method.</p>

<p>This arrangement is frequently needed with traits that implement
stackable modifications.  To tell the compiler you are doing this on
purpose, you must mark such methods as <span class="code">abstract</span> <span class="code">override</span>.<a id="i-1048822646-1"></a> This
combination of modifiers is only allowed for members of traits, not classes, and it
means that the trait must be mixed into some class that has a concrete
definition of the method in question.</p>

<p>There is a lot going on with such a simple trait, isn't there!
Here's how it looks to use the trait:
<pre>
  scala&gt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">MyQueue</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">BasicIntQueue</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Doubling</span>
  <span class="output">defined&nbsp;class&nbsp;MyQueue</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;queue&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">MyQueue</span>
  <span class="output">queue:&nbsp;MyQueue&nbsp;=&nbsp;MyQueue@91f017</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.put(<span class="literal">10</span>)
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.get()
  <span class="output">res12:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;20</span>
</pre><!-- --></p>

<p>In the first line in this interpreter session, we define class <span class="code">MyQueue</span>, which extends
<span class="code">BasicIntQueue</span> and mixes in <span class="code">Doubling</span>.  We then put a 10 in the
queue, but because <span class="code">Doubling</span> has been mixed in, the 10 is doubled.  When we get an integer from the queue, it is a
20.</p>

<p>Note that <span class="code">MyQueue</span> defines no new code.  It simply identifies a
class and mixes in a trait.  In this situation, you could
supply "<span class="code">BasicIntQueue</span> <span class="code">with</span> <span class="code">Doubling</span>" directly to <span class="code">new</span>
instead of defining a named class. It would look as shown in <a href="traits.html#lst:new-with">Listing 12.9</a>:</p>

<p><a name="lst:new-with"></a></p>

<pre>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;scala&gt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;queue&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">BasicIntQueue</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Doubling</span>
  <span class="output">&nbsp;&nbsp;queue:&nbsp;BasicIntQueue&nbsp;with&nbsp;Doubling&nbsp;=&nbsp;$anon$1@5fa12d</span>
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.put(<span class="literal">10</span>)
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.get()
  <span class="output">&nbsp;&nbsp;res14:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;20</span>
</pre><!-- -->

  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre><!-- -->


<h5>Listing 12.10 - Stackable modification traits <span class="code">Incrementing</span> and <span class="code">Filtering</span>.</h5>


<p>Given these modifications, you can now pick and choose which ones you
want for a particular queue.  For example, here is a queue that
both filters negative numbers and adds one to all numbers that
it keeps:
<pre>
  scala&gt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;queue&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">BasicIntQueue</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Incrementing</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Filtering</span>)
  <span class="output">queue:&nbsp;BasicIntQueue&nbsp;with&nbsp;Incrementing&nbsp;with&nbsp;Filtering...</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.put(-<span class="literal">1</span>);&nbsp;queue.put(<span class="literal">0</span>);&nbsp;queue.put(<span class="literal">1</span>)
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.get()
  <span class="output">res15:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.get()
  <span class="output">res16:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;2</span>
</pre><!-- --></p>

<p>The order of mixins is significant.<a href="traits.html#footnote12-2">[2]</a>  The precise rules are given in
the following section, but, roughly speaking, traits further to the
right take effect first.  When you call a method on a class with
mixins, the method in the trait furthest to the right is called first.
If that method calls <span class="code">super</span>, it invokes the method in the next trait
to its left, and so on.  In the previous example, <span class="code">Filtering</span>'s
<span class="code">put</span> is invoked first, so it removes integers that were negative to
begin with.  <span class="code">Incrementing</span>'s <span class="code">put</span> is invoked second, so it adds
one to those integers that remain.</p>

<p>If you reverse the order, first integers will be incremented, and
<em>then</em> the integers that are still negative will be discarded:
<pre>
  scala&gt;&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;queue&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">BasicIntQueue</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Filtering</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Incrementing</span>)
  <span class="output">queue:&nbsp;BasicIntQueue&nbsp;with&nbsp;Filtering&nbsp;with&nbsp;Incrementing...</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.put(-<span class="literal">1</span>);&nbsp;queue.put(<span class="literal">0</span>);&nbsp;queue.put(<span class="literal">1</span>)
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.get()
  <span class="output">res17:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.get()
  <span class="output">res18:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</span>
  <br />  scala&gt;&nbsp;queue.get()
  <span class="output">res19:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;2</span>
</pre><!-- --></p>

<p>Overall, code written in this style gives you a great deal of
flexibility.  You can define sixteen different classes by mixing in
these three traits in different combinations and orders.  That's a
lot of flexibility for a small amount of code, so you should keep your
eyes open for opportunities to arrange code as stackable modifications.</p>

<h3><a name="12.6"></a>12.6 Why not multiple inheritance? <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="traits.html#12.6">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p><a name="sec:traits-vs-multi"></a></p>

<p><a name="sec:linearization"></a>
<a id="i-1280910181-1"></a><a id="i1595934381-1"></a>
<a id="i-1992074038-1"></a></p>

<p>Traits are a way to inherit from multiple class-like constructs, but
they differ in important ways from the multiple inheritance present
in many languages.  One difference is especially important: the
interpretation of <span class="code">super</span>. With multiple inheritance, the method called by a <span class="code">super</span> call can be
determined right where the call appears.  With traits, the method
called is determined by a <em>linearization</em> of the classes and
traits that are mixed into a class. This is the difference that enables the
stacking of modifications described in the previous section.</p>

<p>Before looking at linearization, take a moment to consider how to
stack modifications in a language with traditional multiple inheritance.
Imagine the following code, but this time interpreted as
multiple inheritance instead of trait mixin:
<pre>
  <span class="comment">//&nbsp;Multiple&nbsp;inheritance&nbsp;thought&nbsp;experiment</span>
  <span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;q&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="vem">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">BasicIntQueue</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Incrementing</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Doubling</span>
  q.put(<span class="literal">42</span>)&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">//&nbsp;which&nbsp;put&nbsp;would&nbsp;be&nbsp;called?</span>
</pre><!-- -->
The first question is, which <span class="code">put</span> method would get invoked by this call?
Perhaps the rule would be that the last superclass wins, in which case
<span class="code">Doubling</span> would get called.  <span class="code">Doubling</span> would double its argument and
call <span class="code">super.put</span>, and that would be it.  No incrementing would happen!  Likewise,
if the rule were that the first superclass wins, the resulting queue
would increment integers but not double them.  Thus neither ordering would work.</p>

<p>You might also entertain the possibility of allowing programmers to identify exactly which superclass method
they want when they say <span class="code">super</span>. For example, imagine the following Scala-like code, in which <span class="code">super</span> appears to be explicitly invoked
on both <span class="code">Incrementing</span> and <span class="code">Doubling</span>:
<pre>
  <span class="comment">//&nbsp;Multiple&nbsp;inheritance&nbsp;thought&nbsp;experiment</span>
  <span class="vem">trait</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">MyQueue</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">BasicIntQueue</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Incrementing</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Doubling</span>&nbsp;{
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;put(x:&nbsp;<span class="typename">Int</span>)&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incrementing.super.put(x)&nbsp;<span class="comment">//&nbsp;(Not&nbsp;real&nbsp;Scala)</span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubling.super.put(x)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
  }
</pre><!-- --></p>

<p>This approach would give us new problems.
The verbosity of this attempt is the least of its problems.  What would happen is that the base class's <span class="code">put</span> method would get called
<em>twice</em>&mdash;once with an incremented value and once with a doubled
value, but neither time with an incremented, doubled value.</p>

<p>There is simply no good solution to this problem using multiple
inheritance.  You would have to back up in your design and factor
the code differently.  By contrast,
the traits solution in Scala is straightforward.  You simply mix in
<span class="code">Incrementing</span> and <span class="code">Doubling</span>, and Scala's special
treatment of <span class="code">super</span> in traits makes it all work out.  Something is clearly
different here from traditional multiple inheritance, but what?
As hinted previously, the answer is  linearization.  When you instantiate a class with
<span class="code">new</span>, Scala takes the class and all of its inherited classes and
traits and puts them in a single, <em>linear</em> order.  Then,
whenever you call <span class="code">super</span> inside one of those classes, the invoked
method is the next one up the chain.  If all of the methods but the
last call <span class="code">super</span>, the net result is stackable behavior.</p>

<p>The precise order of the linearization is described in the language
specification.  It is a little bit complicated, but the main thing you need
to know is that, in any linearization, a class is 
always linearized
before <em>all</em> of its superclasses and mixed in traits.  Thus, when
you write a method that calls <span class="code">super</span>, that method is definitely
modifying the behavior of the superclasses and mixed in traits, not
the other way around.</p>

<p>The remainder of this section describes the details of linearization. 
You can safely skip the rest of this section if you are
not interested in understanding those details right now.</p>

<p>The main properties of Scala's linearization are illustrated by the
following example: Say you have a class <span class="code">Cat</span>, which inherits from a superclass <span class="code">Animal</span> and 
two traits <span class="code">Furry</span> and <span class="code">FourLegged</span>. <span class="code">FourLegged</span> extends in turn another trait 
<span class="code">HasLegs</span>: 
<pre>
  <span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Animal</span>&nbsp;
  <span class="vem">trait</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Furry</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Animal</span>
  <span class="vem">trait</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">HasLegs</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Animal</span>
  <span class="vem">trait</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">FourLegged</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">HasLegs</span>
  <span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Cat</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Animal</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">Furry</span>&nbsp;<span class="vem">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">FourLegged</span>
</pre><!-- --></p>

<p>Class <span class="code">Cat</span>'s inheritance hierarchy and linearization are shown in <a href="traits.html#fig:linearization">Figure 12.1</a>. Inheritance is indicated
using traditional UML notation:<a href="traits.html#footnote12-3">[3]</a> arrows with white, triangular arrowheads indicate inheritance, with the 
arrowhead pointing to the supertype. The arrows with darkened, non-triangular arrowheads depict linearization. The darkened arrowheads point in the
direction in which <span class="code">super</span> calls will be resolved.</p>

</div>
<h5> Figure 12.1 - Inheritance hierarchy and linearization of class <span class="code">Cat</span>.</h5>


<p>The linearization of <span class="code">Cat</span> is computed from back to front as follows. 
The <span style="font-style:italic">last</span> part of the linearization of <span class="code">Cat</span> is the linearization of
its superclass, <span class="code">Animal</span>. This linearization is copied over without any changes. 
(The linearization of each of these types is shown in <a href="traits.html#tab:linearization-several">Table 12.1</a> <a href="traits.html#tab:linearization-several">here</a>.)
Because <span class="code">Animal</span> doesn't explicitly extend a superclass or mix in any supertraits, it by default
extends <span class="code">AnyRef</span>, which extends <span class="code">Any</span>. <span class="code">Animal</span>'s linearization, therefore, looks like:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="images/AnimalLine.jpg" alt="image images/AnimalLine.jpg"/>


</div>


<p><!-- -->The second to last part is the linearization of the first mixin, 
trait <span class="code">Furry</span>, but all classes that are already in the linearization of <span class="code">Animal</span> 
are left out now, so that each class appears only once in <span class="code">Cat</span>'s linearization.
The result is:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="images/FurryLine.jpg" alt="image images/FurryLine.jpg"/>


</div>


<p><!-- -->This is preceded by the linearization of <span class="code">FourLegged</span>, where again any classes
that have already been copied in the linearizations of the superclass or 
the first mixin are left out:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="images/FourLeggedLine.jpg" alt="image images/FourLeggedLine.jpg"/>


</div>


<p><!-- -->Finally, the first class in the linearization of 
<span class="code">Cat</span> is <span class="code">Cat</span> itself:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="images/CatLine.jpg" alt="image images/CatLine.jpg"/>


</div>


<p><!-- -->When any of these classes and traits invokes a method via <span class="code">super</span>, the implementation invoked will 
be the first implementation to its right in the linearization.</p>

<h3><a name="12.7"></a>12.7 To trait, or not to trait? <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="traits.html#12.7">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p>Whenever you implement a reusable collection of behavior, you will
have to decide whether you want to use a trait or an abstract class.
There is no firm rule, but this section contains a few guidelines to consider.</p>

<p><em>If the behavior will not be reused</em>, then make it a
concrete class.  It is not reusable behavior after all.</p>

<p><em>If it might be reused in multiple, unrelated classes</em>, make
it a trait.  Only traits can be mixed into different parts of the
class hierarchy.</p>

<p><em>If you want to inherit from it in Java code</em>, use an abstract class.
Since traits with code do not have a close Java analog, it tends to be
awkward to inherit from a trait in a Java class.  Inheriting from a Scala class,
meanwhile, is exactly like inheriting from a Java class.  As one exception,
a Scala trait with only abstract members translates directly to a Java interface,
so you should feel free to define such traits even if you expect Java
code to inherit from it.  See <a href="combining-scala-and-java.html">Chapter 29</a>
for more information on working with Java and Scala together.</p>

<p><em>If you plan to distribute it in compiled form</em>, and you
expect outside groups to write classes inheriting from it,
you might lean towards using an abstract class.  The issue is that
when a trait gains or loses a member, any classes that inherit from
it must be recompiled, even if they have not changed.  If outside
clients will only call into the behavior, instead of inheriting
from it, then using a trait is fine.</p>

<p><em>If efficiency is very important</em>, lean towards using a class. Most<a id="i991539031-1"></a>
Java runtimes make a virtual method invocation of a class member a
faster operation than an interface method invocation. Traits get
compiled to interfaces and therefore may pay a slight performance
overhead.  However, you should make this choice only if you know that
the trait in question constitutes a performance
bottleneck and have evidence that using a class instead actually solves the problem.</p>

<p><em>If you still do not know</em>, after considering the above, then
start by making it as a trait.  You can always change it later, and
in general using a trait keeps more options open.</p>

<h3><a name="12.8"></a>12.8 Conclusion <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="traits.html#12.8">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p>This chapter has shown you how traits work and how to use them in
several common idioms.  You saw that traits are similar to
multiple inheritance, but because they interpret <span class="code">super</span> using
linearization, they both avoid some of the difficulties of traditional multiple
inheritance, and allow you to stack behaviors.  You also saw the <span class="code">Ordered</span> trait and learned how to write your own enrichment traits.</p>

<p>Now that you have seen all of these facets, it is worth stepping back
and taking another look at traits as a whole.  Traits do not merely
support the idioms described in this chapter.  They are a fundamental
unit of code that is reusable through inheritance.  Because of this
nature, many experienced Scala programmers start with traits when they
are at the early stages of implementation.  Each trait can hold less
than an entire concept, a mere fragment of a concept.  As the design
solidifies, the fragments can be combined into more complete concepts
through trait mixin.</p>

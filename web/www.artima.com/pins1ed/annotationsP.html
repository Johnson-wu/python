<p>Annotations are structured information added to program source code.
Like comments, they can be sprinkled throughout a program
and attached to any variable, method, expression, or other
program element.  Unlike comments, they have structure, thus making
them easier to machine process.</p>

<p>This chapter shows how to use annotations in Scala.  It shows their general
syntax and how to use several
standard annotations.</p>

<p>This chapter does not show how to write new annotation processing
tools, because it is beyond the scope of this book.
<a href="combining-scala-and-java.html">Chapter 29</a> shows one technique,
but not the only one.
Instead, this chapter focuses on how to use annotations, because it is more
common to use annotations than to define new annotation processors.</p>

<h3><a name="25.1"></a>25.1 Why have annotations? <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="annotations.html#25.1">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p>There are many things you can do with a program other than compiling and
running it.  Some examples are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Automatic generation of documentation as with
Scaladoc<a id="i-827321774-1"></a>.
</li>
<li>Pretty printing code so that it matches your preferred style.
</li>
<li>Checking code for common errors such as opening a file but,
      on some control paths, never closing it.
</li>
<li>Experimental type checking, for example to manage
      side effects or ensure ownership properties.
</li></ol>


<p>Such tools are called <a href="glossary.html#g-850220783"><em>meta-programming</em></a> tools, because they are
programs that take other programs as
input.<a id="i-850220783-1"></a><a id="i544128342-1"></a>
Annotations support these tools by letting the programmer sprinkle
directives to the tool throughout their source code.  Such directives
let the tools be more effective than if they could have no user input.
For example, annotations
can improve the previously listed tools as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>A documentation generator could be instructed to document
      certain methods as deprecated.
</li>
<li>A pretty printer could be instructed to skip over parts
      of the program that have been carefully hand formatted.
</li>
<li>A checker for non-closed files could be instructed to ignore
      a particular file that has been manually verified to be
      closed.
</li>
<li>A side-effects checker could be instructed to verify
      that a specified method has no side effects.
</li></ol>


<p>In all of these cases, it would in theory be possible for the
programming language to provide ways to insert the extra information.
In fact, most of these are directly supported in some language or
another.  However, there are too many such tools for one language to
directly support them all.  Further, all of this information is
completely ignored by the compiler, which after all just wants to make
the code run.</p>

<p>Scala's philosophy in cases like this is to include the minimum,
orthogonal support in the core language such that a wide variety of
meta-programming tools can be written.  In this case, that minimum
support is a system of annotations.  The compiler understands just one
feature, annotations, but it doesn't attach any meaning to individual
annotations.  Each meta-programming tool can then define and use its
own specific annotations.</p>

<h3><a name="25.2"></a>25.2 Syntax of annotations <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="annotations.html#25.2">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p>A typical use of an annotation looks like this:<a id="i526469630-1"></a>
<pre>
  @deprecated&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;bigMistake()&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="comment">//...</span>
</pre><!-- -->
The annotation<a id="i-1632344653-1"></a><a id="i86494153-1"></a> is the <span class="code">@deprecated</span> part, and it applies to the
entirety of the <span class="code">bigMistake</span> method (not shown&mdash;it's too
embarrassing).  In this case, the method is being marked as something
the author of <span class="code">bigMistake</span> wishes you not to use.  Maybe
<span class="code">bigMistake</span> will be removed entirely from a future version of the
code.</p>

<p>In the previous example, a method is annotated as
<span class="code">@deprecated</span>.  Annotations are allowed in other places too.
Annotations are allowed on any kind of
declaration or definition, including <span class="code">val</span>s, <span class="code">var</span>s, <span class="code">def</span>s,
<span class="code">class</span>es, <span class="code">object</span>s, <span class="code">trait</span>s, and
<span class="code">type</span>s.<a id="i1935725073-1"></a><a id="i175307031-1"></a><a id="i1767118133-1"></a><a id="i1177206493-1"></a><a id="i911241519-1"></a><a id="i-1756036738-1"></a>  The annotation
applies to the entirety of the declaration or definition that follows
it:
<pre>
  @deprecated&nbsp;<span class="vem">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="typename">QuickAndDirty</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">//...</span>
  }
</pre><!-- -->
Annotations can also be applied to an expression<a id="i726662607-1"></a>, as with the
<span class="code">@unchecked</span> annotation<a id="i-1840852242-3"></a><a id="i-815574504-3"></a> for pattern matching
(see <a href="case-classes-and-pattern-matching.html">Chapter 15</a>).
To do so, place a colon (<span class="code">:</span>) after the expression
and then write the annotation.  Syntactically, it looks like
the annotation is being used as a type:
<pre>
  (e:&nbsp;@unchecked)&nbsp;<span class="vem">match</span>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">//&nbsp;non-exhaustive&nbsp;cases...</span>
  }
</pre><!-- -->
Finally, annotations can be placed on types.  Annotated types
are described later in this chapter.</p>

<p>So far the annotations shown have been simply an at sign followed
by an annotation class.  Such simple annotations are common and
useful, but annotations have a richer general form:<a id="i2008427102-1"></a></p>

<div align="center">
<span class="code">@</span><em>annot</em><span class="code">(</span><em>exp_{1}, exp_{2}, ...</em><span class="code">)</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"></span>
<span class="code">{val</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"></span><em>name_{1}</em><span class="code">=</span><em>const_{1}</em><span class="code">,</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"></span>...<span class="code">,</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">val</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"></span><em>name_{<i>n</i>}</em><span class="code">=</span><em>const_{<i>n</i>}</em><span class="code">}</span>


</div>


<p>The <em>annot</em> specifies the class of annotation.  
All annotations must include that much.
The <em>exp</em><a id="i-1204896229-1"></a>
parts are arguments to the annotation.  For annotations like
<span class="code">@deprecated</span> that do not need any arguments, you would normally
leave off the parentheses, but you can write <span class="code">@deprecated()</span> if
you like.  For annotations that do have arguments, place the arguments
in parentheses, for example, <span class="code">@serial(1234)</span>.</p>

<p>The precise form of the arguments you may give to an annotation depends
on the particular annotation class.  Most annotation processors only
let you supply immediate constants such as <span class="code">123</span> or <span class="code">"hello"</span>.  The
compiler itself supports arbitrary expressions, however, so long as
they type check.  Some annotation classes can make use of this, for
example, to let you refer to other variables that are in scope:
<pre>
  @cool&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;normal&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="quotedstring">"Hello"</span>
  @coolerThan(normal)&nbsp;<span class="vem">val</span>&nbsp;fonzy&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="quotedstring">"Heeyyy"</span>
</pre><!-- --></p>

<p>The <em>name</em><span class="code">=</span><em>const</em> pairs in the general syntax are
available for more complicated annotations that have optional
arguments.  These arguments are optional, and they can be specified
in any order.  To keep things simple, the part to the right-hand side
of the equals sign must be a constant.<!-- --><!-- --></p>

<h3><a name="25.3"></a>25.3 Standard annotations <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="annotations.html#25.3">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p>Scala includes several standard annotations.<a id="i-178318765-1"></a><!-- -->  They are for features
that are used widely enough to merit putting in the language
specification, but that are not fundamental enough to merit their own
syntax.  Over time, there should be a trickle of new annotations that
are added to the standard in just the same way.</p>

<h4>Deprecation</h4>


<p>Sometimes you write a class or method that you later wish you had not.
Once it is available, though, code written by other people might call
the method.  Thus, you cannot simply delete the method,
because this would cause other people's code to stop compiling.</p>

<p>Deprecation lets you gracefully remove a method or class that turns
out to be a mistake.  You mark the method or class as deprecated, and
then anyone who calls that method or class will get a deprecation
warning.  They had better heed this warning and update their code!
The idea is that after a suitable amount of time has passed, you feel
safe in assuming that all reasonable clients will have stopped
accessing the deprecated class or method and thus that you can safely
remove it.</p>

<p>You mark a method as deprecated simply by writing <span class="code">@deprecated</span>
before it.  For example:
<pre>
  @deprecated&nbsp;<span class="vem">def</span>&nbsp;bigMistake()&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">//...</span>
</pre><!-- -->
Such an annotation will cause the Scala compiler to emit deprecation warnings
whenever Scala code accesses the method.</p>

<h4>Volatile fields</h4>


<p>Concurrent programming does not mix well with shared mutable state.
For this reason, the focus of Scala's concurrency support is message
passing and a minimum of shared mutable state.  See
<a href="actors-and-concurrency.html">Chapter 30</a> for the details.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, sometimes programmers want to use mutable state in their
concurrent programs.  The <span class="code">@volatile</span> annotation<a id="i-882906061-1"></a><a id="i915992882-1"></a>
helps in such
cases.  It informs the compiler that the variable in question will be
used by multiple threads.  Such variables are implemented so
that reads and writes to the variable are slower, but accesses from
multiple threads behave more predictably.</p>

<p>The <span class="code">@volatile</span> keyword gives different guarantees on different
platforms.  On the Java platform, however, you get the same behavior as if you
wrote the field in Java code and marked it with the Java <span class="code">volatile</span>
modifier.</p>

<h4>Binary serialization</h4>


<p>Many languages include a framework for binary <a href="glossary.html#g922807280"><em>serialization</em></a>.<a id="i-1448460597-1"></a><a id="i2082703927-1"></a>  A
serialization framework helps you convert objects into a stream of
bytes and <i>vice versa</i>.  This is useful if you want to save objects
to disk or send them over the network.  XML can help with the same
goals (see <a href="working-with-xml.html">Chapter 26</a>), but it has different
trade offs regarding speed, space usage, flexibility, and portability.</p>

<p>Scala does not have its own serialization framework.  Instead, you
should use a framework from your underlying platform.  What Scala does
is provide three annotations that are useful for a variety of
frameworks.  Also, the Scala compiler for the Java platform interprets
these annotations in the Java way (see
<a href="combining-scala-and-java.html">Chapter 29</a>).</p>

<p>The first annotation indicates whether a class is serializable at all.
Most classes are serializable, but not all. A handle to a socket or GUI window, for example,
cannot be serialized.  By default, a class is not
considered serializable.  You should add a <span class="code">@serializable</span><a id="i-534731536-1"></a><a id="i-897281643-1"></a>
annotation to any class you would like to be serializable.</p>

<p>The second annotation helps deal with serializable classes changing as
time goes by.  You can attach a serial number to the current version
of a class by adding an annotation like<a id="i-744810718-1"></a><a id="i-1236272573-1"></a>
<span class="code">@SerialVersionUID(1234)</span>, where <span class="code">1234</span> should be replaced by
your serial number of choice.  The framework should store this number
in the generated byte stream.  When you later reload that byte stream
and try to convert it to an object, the framework can check that the
current version of the class has the same version number as the
version in the byte stream.  If you want to make a
serialization-incompatible change to your class, then you can change
the version number.  The framework will then automatically refuse to
load old instances of the class.</p>

<p>Finally, Scala provides a <span class="code">@transient</span> annotation<a id="i875595397-1"></a><a id="i2078024116-1"></a> for fields that
should not be serialized at all.  If you mark a field as
<span class="code">@transient</span>, then the framework should not save the field even
when the surrounding object is serialized.  When the object is loaded,
the field will be restored to the default value for the type of the
field annotated as <span class="code">@transient</span>.</p>

<h4>Automatic <span class="code">get</span> and <span class="code">set</span> methods</h4>


<p>Scala code normally does not need explicit <span class="code">get</span> and <span class="code">set</span> methods for
fields, because Scala blends the syntax for field access and method
invocation.  Some platform-specific frameworks do expect <span class="code">get</span> and <span class="code">set</span> methods, however.  For that purpose, Scala provides the
<span class="code">@scala.reflect.BeanProperty</span> annotation.<a id="i732073940-1"></a><a id="i1595748955-1"></a>
If you add this annotation to a field, the compiler will automatically
generate <span class="code">get</span> and <span class="code">set</span> methods for you.  If you annotate a field
named <span class="code">crazy</span>, the <span class="code">get</span> method will be named <span class="code">getCrazy</span> and the <span class="code">set</span> method
will be named <span class="code">setCrazy</span>.</p>

<p>The generated <span class="code">get</span> and <span class="code">set</span> methods are only available after a compilation
pass completes.  Thus, you cannot call these <span class="code">get</span> and <span class="code">set</span> methods from
code you compile at the same time as the annotated fields.  This
should not be a problem in practice, because in Scala code you can
access the fields directly.  This feature is intended to support
frameworks that expect regular <span class="code">get</span> and <span class="code">set</span> methods, and typically you
do not compile the framework and the code that uses it at the same
time.</p>

<h4>Unchecked</h4>


<p>The <span class="code">@unchecked</span> annotation is interpreted by the compiler during
pattern matches.  It tells the compiler not to worry if the
<span class="code">match</span> expression seems to leave out some cases.  See
<a href="case-classes-and-pattern-matching.html#sec:sealed-classes">Section 15.5</a> for details.</p>

<h3><a name="25.4"></a>25.4 Conclusion <span style="font-size: .5em">[<a href="annotations.html#25.4">link</a>]</span></h3>


<p>This chapter described the platform-independent aspects of
annotations that you will most commonly need to know about.  First of
all it covered the syntax of annotations, because using
annotations is far more common than defining new ones.  Second it showed how to use several annotations that are supported by the standard
Scala compiler, including <span class="code">@deprecated</span>, <span class="code">@volatile</span>,
<span class="code">@serializable</span>, <span class="code">@BeanProperty</span>, and <span class="code">@unchecked</span>.</p>

<p><a href="combining-scala-and-java.html">Chapter 29</a> gives additional,
Java-specific information on annotations.  It covers annotations only
available when targeting Java, additional meanings of standard
annotations when targeting Java, how to interoperate with Java-based
annotations, and how to use Java-based mechanisms to define and
process annotations in Scala.</p>

      <p>
        Getting code to do what we want it to do is perhaps the
        essence of our purpose as developers. So there are few
        things more intriguing or important than code that we
        think we understand, but that behaves rather contrary to
        our expectations.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <em>Scala Puzzlers</em> is a collection of such examples
        in Scala. It is not only an entertaining and instructive
        way of understanding this highly expressive language
        better. It will also help you recognize many
        counter-intuitive traps and pitfalls and prevent them
        from inflicting further production bug hunt stress on
        Scala developers.

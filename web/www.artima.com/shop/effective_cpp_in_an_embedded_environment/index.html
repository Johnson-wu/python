        This PDF document contains the presentation materials from Scott
        Meyers' two-day training course Effective C++ in an Embedded
        Environment.
It provides an in-depth examination of how C++ can be applied in embedded systems, including costs of language features,
ROMing, ISRs, memory management, safety-critical and real-time considerations, and more.

<h1>Features</h1>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Same content as the training course:</strong> The PDF you'll
        get is an exact snapshot of Scott's full-color training materials on the
        day he generates the PDF.  You'll get not only the
        slides Scott shows in class, you'll also get the accompanying notes&mdash;the
very ones Scott uses.  To see exactly what you'll get you can
         <a href="/samples/effCppEmbNotesSample.pdf">view a free sample</a>.</li>
      
<br />
<li><strong>No DRM:</strong> You may copy the PDF to as
many devices as you like, annotate it in any way you want, print it in part
or in full as many times as you choose. Because the PDF is for your
personal use only, you are not permitted to provide copies to friends or
colleagues, may not install it on servers for public access, can't use it
as the basis for presentations, etc., but we trust you to adhere to these
restrictions; the PDF itself doesn't try to prevent unauthorized uses. (For
more permissive usage options, consider <a href="http://www.aristeia.com/Licensing/licensing.html">licensing
the materials</a>.)</li>
      
<br />
        <li><strong>Free updates for life:</strong> You are entitled to
        free updates to the materials as long as Scott produces them.  
        Major revisions are included, so you won't have to pay again later for a &quot;new edition.&quot;</li>

<br />
<li><strong>Volume discounts</strong>: Want a copy for every member of your team or department? Discounts of 30-50% off single-PDF prices apply to purchases of as few as 10 copies. As the saying goes, the more you buy, the more you save! Consult the <a href="/shop/volume_discounts">discount schedule</a> for details.</li>

<h1>About the course</h1>

  <p>
    C++'s flexibility, modelling power, support for
    object-oriented and generic programming, and extensive tool
    set, make it attractive for embedded projects, but some
    developers worry about code bloat and hidden performance
    penalties. This seminar begins by confronting those issues
    directly, then moves on to demonstrate how C++ can improve
    the correctness, readability, and efficiency of embedded
    software, in some cases accomplishing what is literally
    impossible in C.
  </p>

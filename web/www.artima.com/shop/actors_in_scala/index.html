<p>
Actors in Scala is the authoritative guide to programming with the actors
framework of Scala's standard library, co-written by the creator and lead
maintainer, Philipp Haller. The book provides a comprehensive introduction
to the actor model of concurrency and shows how Scala's
actors enable you to build efficient, scalable, and robust concurrent software for the JVM.

<p>
Recent trends in computer architecture make concurrency and parallelism an essential ingredient of efficient program execution. The actor model of concurrency allows you to express real-world concurrency in a natural way using concurrent processes that communicate via asynchronous messages.
</p>

<p>
Scala is a programming language for the Java virtual machine, providing excellent support for both object-oriented and functional programming. By including a powerful actor framework in its standard library, Scala offers a compelling approach to tackle concurrent programming. Scala's actors let you apply the actor concurrency model to the JVM, enabling real-world solutions that are efficient, scalable, and robust.
</p>

<p>
Published by Artima, this is the first book on Scala's actors, co-authored by the creator and lead maintainer, Philipp Haller, and Frank Sommers. Starting with the fundamentals of the actor concurrency model, this book offers a comprehensive tutorial on practical programming with actors in Scala. It enables you to leverage the full power of today's and tomorrow's multi-core processors by describing both basic and advanced features of Scala's actor framework in-depth.

<b>Philipp Haller</b> 
is a post-doctoral researcher at Stanford University, USA, and at EPFL, Switzerland. He holds a Dipl.-Inform. degree from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from EPFL, Switzerland. As a member of the Scala team at EPFL he has been working on programming abstractions for concurrency, as well as type systems to check their safety. Philipp created Scala Actors, a library for efficient, high-level concurrent programming.

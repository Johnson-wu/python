<p>
Scala is an object-oriented programming language for the Java Virtual
Machine. In addition to being object-oriented, Scala is also a
functional language, and combines the best approaches to OO and
functional programming.
</p>

<p>
In Italian, Scala means a stairway, or steps&#8212;indeed, Scala lets you step up to a programming environment that incorporates some of the
best recent thinking in programming language design while also letting
you use all your existing Java code.
</p>

<p>
Artima is very pleased to publish a new edition of the best-selling book on Scala, written by
the designer of the language, Martin Odersky. Co-authored by Lex Spoon and Bill Venners,
this book
takes a step-by-step tutorial approach to teaching you Scala. Starting
with the fundamental elements of the language, <em>Programming in Scala</em>
introduces functional programming from the practitioner's perspective, and
describes advanced language features that can make you a better, more
productive developer.

The first edition of <em>Programming in Scala</em> won the 2009 Jolt Productivity Award in the Technical Books category.
</p>
<h1>Praise for the first edition</h1>
<span style="font-size: 0.85em">
<p>
<em>Programming in Scala</em> is clearly written, thorough, and easy to follow. It has great examples and useful tips throughout. 
It has enabled our organization to ramp up on the Scala language quickly and efficiently. This book is great for any programmer
who is trying to wrap their head around the flexibility and elegance of the Scala language.
</p>
<p>
- Larry Morroni, Owner, Morroni Technologies, Inc.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Programming in Scala</em> book serves as an excellant tutorial to the Scala language. Working
through the book, it flows well with each chapter building on concepts and examples described in earlier ones.
The book takes care to explain the language constructs in depth, often providing examples of how the language differs
from Java. As well as the main language, there is also some coverage of libraries such as containers and actors.
</p>
</p>
I have found the book really easy to work through, and it is probably one of the better written technical books I have read
recently. I really would recommend this book to any programmer wanting to find out more about the Scala language.
</p>
<p>
- Matthew Todd
</p>
<p>
I am amazed by the effort undertaken by the authors of <em>Programming in
Scala</em>. This book is an invaluable guide to what I like to call Scala
the Platform: a vehicle to better coding, a constant inspiration for
scalable software design and implementation. If only I had Scala in its
present mature state and this book on my desk back in 2003, when
co-designing and implementing parts of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games
Portal infrastructure!
</p>

<p>
To all readers: No matter what your programming background is, I feel
you will find programming in Scala liberating and this book will be a
loyal friend in the journey.
</p>
<p>
- Christos KK Loverdos, Software Consultant, Researcher
</p>

<p>
<em>Programming in Scala</em> is a superb in-depth introduction to
Scala, and it's also an excellent reference. I'd say that it
occupies a prominent place on my bookshelf, except that I'm still
carrying it around with me nearly everywhere I go.
</p>
<p>
- Brian Clapper, President, ArdenTex, Inc.
</p>
<p>
I bought an early electronic version of the <em>Programming in Scala</em> book, by Odersky, Spoon, and Venners, and I
was immediately a fan. In addition to the fact that it contains the most comprehensive information about the language,
there are a few key features of the electronic format that impressed me.  I have never seen links used as well in a PDF,
not just for bookmarks, but also providing active links from the table of contents and index.  I don't know why more
authors don't use this feature, because it's really a joy for the reader.  Another feature which I was impressed with
was links to the forums ("Discuss") and a way to send comments ("Suggest") to the authors via email.  The comments
feature by itself isn't all that uncommon, but the simple inclusion of a page number in what is generated to send
to the authors is valuable for both the authors and readers.  I contributed more comments than I would have if the
process would have been more arduous.
</p>
<p>
Read <em>Programming in Scala</em> for the content, but if you're reading the electronic version, definitely take
advantage of the digital features that the authors took the care to build in!
</p>
<p>
- Dianne Marsh, Founder/Software Consultant, SRT Solutions
</p>

<p>
Great book, well written with thoughtful examples. I would recommend it
to both seasoned programmers and newbies.
</p>
<p>
- Howard Lovatt
</p>
<p>
The book <em>Programming in Scala</em> is not only about &lsquo;How?,&rsquo; but more
importantly about &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; to develop programs in this new programming
language. The book&rsquo;s pragmatic approach in introducing the power of
combining object-oriented and functional programming leaves the reader
without any doubts as to what Scala really is.
</p>
<p>
- Dr. Ervin Varga, CEO/founder, EXPRO I.T. Consulting
</p>
<p>
This is a great introduction to functional programming for OO
programmers. Learning about FP was my main goal, but I also got
acquainted with some nice Scala surprises like case classes and pattern
matching. Scala is an intriguing language and this book covers it well.
</p>

<p>
There's always a fine line to walk in a language introduction book
between giving too much or not enough information. I find <em>Programming
in Scala</em> to achieve a perfect balance.
</p>
<p>
- Jeff Heon, Programmer Analyst
</p>
<p>
Lucidity and technical completeness are
hallmarks of any well-written book, and I congratulate Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners on a job indeed very well
done! The <em>Programming in Scala</em> book starts by setting a strong foundation with the basic concepts and ramps up
the user to an intermediate level & beyond. This book is certainly a must buy for anyone aspiring to learn Scala.  
</p>
<p>
- Jagan Nambi, Enterprise Architecture, GMAC Financial Services
</p>
<p>
The book <em>Programming in Scala</em> outright oozes the huge amount of hard work that has gone into it. I've never
read a tutorial-style book before that accomplishes to be introductory yet comprehensive: in their (misguided) attempt
to be approachable and not "confuse" the reader, most tutorials silently ignore aspects of a subject that are too advanced
for the current discussion. This leaves a very bad taste, as one can never be sure as to the understanding one has
achieved. There is always some residual "magic" that hasn't been explained and cannot be judged at all by the reader. This
book never does that, it never takes anything for granted: every detail is either sufficiently explained or a reference
to a later explanation is given. Indeed, the text is extensively cross-referenced and indexed, so that forming a complete
picture of a complex topic is relatively easy.
</p>
<p>
- Gerald Loeffler, Enterprise Java Architect
</p>
<p>
<em>Programming in Scala</em> is a pleasure to read. This is one of those well-written technical books that
provide deep and comprehensive coverage of the subject in exceptionally concise and elegant manner.
</p>

<p>
The book organized in a very natural and logical way.
It is equally well suited for a curious technologist who
just wants to stay on top of the current trends and a professional seeking deep understanding of the language core
features and its design rationales. I highly recommend it to all interested in functional programming in general. For
the Scala developers, this book is unconditionally a must-read.
</p>
<p>
- Igor Khlystov, Software Architect/Lead Programmer, Greystone Inc.
</p>
<p>
<em>Programming in Scala</em> is probably one of the best programming books I've ever read.
I like the writing style, the brevity, and the thorough
explanations. The book seems to be answer every question as it enters my mind&emdash;it's always one step ahead of me. The
authors don't just give you some code and take things for granted. They give you the meat so you really
understand what's going on. I really like that. 
</p>
<p>
- Ken Egervari, Chief Software Architect
</p>
<p>
<em>Programming in Scala</em> by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners:
in times where good programming books are rare, this excellent
introduction for intermediate programmers really stands out. You&rsquo;ll find
everything here you need to learn this promising language.

Complexity management is a major issue facing the professional programmer today. A programmer building an
Internet-based application interacts with, on average, no less than a dozen technologies. These applications
need nearly continuous operation: 24-7 availability in order to
service hundreds to thousands of concurrent requests. Developers need the tools to manage
that complexity and <em>Monadic Design Patterns for the Web</em> serves that need. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
<em>Monadic Design Patterns for the Web</em> aims to demystify the monad. Using web applications as an example, this book will
show you how you can apply monadic design patterns to help you solve practical, real-world programming problems. Reading this
book will arm you with important techniques that will help you manage complexity.

<b>L. G. Meredith</b> has supported his math habit by working in computing.
He is co-founder of Biosimilarity, LLC, a software consultancy in the
Pacific Northwest. He was the principal architect of Microsoft
BizTalk's Process Orchestration offering and took on the burden of
contributing to the early Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) spec
(to keep it from being more of a train wreck than it was). He also
worked on Microsoft's BigTop project, working on an Operating
System/Programming Language pair based on process calculi. Prior to
that he was one of the core members of the Carnot Team at the first
industrial research consortium, the now defunct Microelectronics and
Computer Technology Corporation (MCC). There he worked with Christine Tomlinson on Rosette/ESS, a fully reflective actor-based
programming language with a high performance execution engine.

    <title>Use Uncertainty As a Driver</title>
    <link>http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=270&amp;thread=351309</link>
    <description>
Uncertainty is normally seen as something you must either suppress or avoid. Of this many people appear, well, certain. That you should embrace it and use it to help determine schedule and design is not immediately obvious.

    <title>Down on the Upside</title>
    <link>http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=270&amp;thread=341298</link>
    <description>
Abstraction is a question of less over more. But is it also a question of high over low? It turns out that the common way of describing abstractions in terms of high-level and low-level hides a number of assumptions, some of which suggest that we often look at abstraction the wrong way up (or down).

    <title>A Test of Knowledge</title>
    <link>http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=270&amp;thread=340842</link>

    <title>Pushing the Limits in Java's Random</title>
    <link>http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=270&amp;thread=340485</link>
    <description>
What is the largest double that could in theory be produced by Math.random()? In this newsletter, we look at ways to calculate this based on the 48-bit random generator available in standard Java. We also prove why in a single-threaded program, (int)(Random.nextDouble() + 1) can never be rounded up to 2.

I'm not talking about the early adopters writing obscure code here -- that can probably be solved with a suitable style guide. I just debugged my way through an example that should have been trivial but I only figured out because:
